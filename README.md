# Before anything...

This project is deemed by me as incomplete as of April 2024. Previously, this program was hardcoded to use a particular address and port since it was only used by me. Now, I want anyone to be able to use it and I want to share this passion project with the world. As such, at the very least it should use a dynamic address/port that a user may specify. Currently, that is the goal as well as a few other tasks.


## Incomplete tasks
- Clean up the code.. Remove redundant code.
- With the previous point, make a sub to execute connection instead of duplicate code.
- Stop using Shell in favor of Process.Start
- Ensure address/port input is working.
- Ensure command windows are hidden during execution for smooth user experience.
- Verify application opens on clicking of taskbar

## Completed tasks
- Added form for address and port input.
- Begun readme
- Rename ambiguous variables like File1, FileName1, FileStream1, BinaryWriter1, BytesToWrite1 etc. Embarassing, but I was a child that many years ago.
- Moved errorbox to sub
- Moved get volume command to sub
- 

# Summary
A GUI nested in the windows task tray to control music on a device running ADB over WIFI.

This is a passion project begun prior to 2019 and I resumed work on it in April 2024.
